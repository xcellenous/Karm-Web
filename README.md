# Karm (Web App)

## Description

Karm is a web app that practically gamifies the idea of being a good neighbor. Karm is short for “Karma” and a derivation on the word “Charm”. The app plays on the idea that good deeds don’t go unnoticed and fosters the development of such good deeds in the local Miami community. Using Geolocation, individuals who are in trouble or in need of help, are matched with individuals who are willing to help – the idea of being a Good Samaritan.

## Build System

We use a host of Gulp plugins to streamline our build process - turning our SASS to CSS files, concatenating our Javascript files and uglifying them to reduce HTTP requests and transpiling JSX to regular Javascript. Make sure to have Node.js, NPM, Bower and Gulp in your system and run `npm install` and `bower install` to install all our dependencies. Run `gulp` to run our build system to automatically do the described tasks above. For more information on Gulp, [click here](http://gulpjs.com/).
