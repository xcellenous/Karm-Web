# Karm (Web App)

## Description

Karm is a web app that practically gamifies the idea of being a good neighbor. Karm is short for “Karma” and a derivation on the word “Charm”. The app plays on the idea that good deeds don’t go unnoticed and fosters the development of such good deeds in the local Miami community. Using Geolocation, individuals who are in trouble or in need of help, are matched with individuals who are willing to help – the idea of being a Good Samaritan.
